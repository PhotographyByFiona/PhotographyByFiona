		<h1>SERVICES</h1>
		
		<h4>《AVAILIBILITY》</h4>
		
		Photography by Fiona is available to operate all days of the week from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday are the most frequently requested days to shoot, be aware of this when you decide to book, as it may be a time longer down the line than you expect. However, situations like this are very uncommon and hardly ever happen. It is with immense care that I advise you of this, as my cutomers happiness and wellbeing are very important to me. Pick a day that is best for you!
		
		<h4>《SCHEDULING & BOOKING》</h4>
		
		Since there is no limit to what day of the week I can work, scheduling relies simply on what time is best for you. Scheduling happens strictly through email or call. I have a spread sheet that I enter the clients information. This includes the hours, the wardrobe, the location, contact information, etc. You can begin setting up shoot by emailing or calling me from the Contact page here on this webiste. It will redirect you to me, then you can share with me your schedule and we can figure out arrangements.  
		
		As you may know, life does not always go our way and if you get caught n one of life's many challenges, do not feel obligated or required to show up. Do not overwork yourself or hold yourself to expectations. Things happen and I understand that. Send me a text or call if there is any problem. See Contact page for more information. 
		
		<h4>《CUSTOMER SATISFACTION》</h4>
		
		One of the main things I do and the biggest part of my job, is to ensure customer satsifaction. You, the customer, are at the core of this practice. The bottom line is that these pictures meet your standards and are what you want. My role is to simply just help you acheive the idea or picture that you have in your head. In essence, my job is to mke your dream come to life. I am here for all of your photography needs and wants, and it is my job to give you what you are looking for. With that being said, feel free to share any of your ideas, wishes, thoughts, or concerns you may have about the photography or the process.
