		<h4>ã€ŠAbout Fionaã€‹</h4>
		My full name is Fiona Kalcevic. I am 18 years old and I from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Growing up was fun because I had access to my parents Ipad. I used this Ipad in my free time to record and put togethor videos. Then, I would show my family the finished product eagerly and feel accomplished. I loved doing this. As I grew older, I used social media and this fostered a new interest in creating photos. After I realized this, I bought my own camera. Naturally, I would take photographs and upload them onto my social media accounts. One day, my friend asked me to take her senior pictures. I was so suprised and happy that she thought I would be good at this. I took her senior pictures and she was very happy with them. This sparked an interest in me to help people and do what I love. My friends and family count on me to take photographs and I am glad they do. Art is where I can find happiness and peace. I love visualizing and creating.
