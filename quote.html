		<h3>Photography by Fiona is the best photography you can get!</h3>
		<p>Photography by Fiona use the Canon EOS 90D. The Canon EOS 90D is an astounding APS-C workhorse of a camera, available for a fantastic price. It combines a highest resolution of 32.5MP, with high-speed frame rate of 10fps, and it also manages glorious uncropped 4K video – none of that irritating crop that has plagued Canon cameras in the past. Its handling and ergonomics are great, and they remind us why shooting on a DSLR is such an enjoyably tactile experience. The EOS 90D is available for a welcome enthusiast price point – not to mention the fact that you get an optical viewfinder, which many people still prefer to the electronic viewfinders on mirrorless cameras. Rumors of the DSLR's death will have been greatly exaggerated if Canon keeps on producing models as good as this.</p>
